                    <h4>Have you ever wondered how to write codes flawlessly without getting any error ?</h4>
                    Well let me tell you <b>even the most experienced coders get errors</b> in their day to day tasks. Coding is something in which no matter how good you become you will always face errors . So <b>you cannot avoid errors</b> but you can become a good coder who solves error and create solutions for that you have to learn problem solving skills , logical thinking and most important loads of practice everyday.<br>
                    <br>
                    Some habits which are very essential to become a good coder are having patience , consistency , practicing . I call it <b>CPP (Consistent practice with patience)</b>  these traits will help you in any walk of life.
                    The key to master any skill or talent comes when you apply CPP in your life . <br>
                    <br>
                    Ok so now we know that we need CPP now we will get into technical aspect where to apply CPP. To become a good coder there are few steps :- <br>
                    1) Choose a programming language<br>
                    2) Learn language syntax and concepts<br>
                    3) Solve questions or build projects for practicing<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Best way is to create projects</b> . The more projects you will make the more you will become good at coding . And at last coding is not something you can learn in one or two days It is something which requires lots of time .
                    <br>
                    <br>Its better to solve one problem a day but making sure you solve daily rather than solving 10 problems a day and not doing anything for a month. So this the key follow it and you are on your way to become a good coder.
